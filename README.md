# qiskit_job_manager

A package for setting up a **server** for the email notification service, and the **client** for interacting with the server.

**Note: While users' passwords are stored only with their hash values, IBM Quantum Token is stored with the original values because the server needs to login the account to retrieve the job status!**



# Server

## Feature

* [X] Basic APIs for IBM Quantum job management based on [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi), including sending emails when job status meets the requirements.
* [X] Ready-to-use register, login, reset passwords, and authentication based on [FastAPI Users](https://github.com/fastapi-users/fastapi-users#readme).
* [X] Based on [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for data storage.

## Set up

1. Install qiskit_job_manager_server package:
   1. Change to the path `qiskit_job_manager/server`.
   2. Install the package by entering the command:
        ```shellscript
            $ pip install .
        ```
2. Configure the environment variables:
   1. Change to the path `qiskit_job_manager/server/qiskit_job_manager_server/configure`
   2. Under the path, copy `.env_example` to `.env` by entering the command:
        ```shellscript
            $ cp .env_example .env
        ```
   3. Edit `.env` to change the environment variables.

## Usage

Start the server by choosing one of the ways:
   1. Directly run the main file by entering the command:
        ```shellscript
            python qiskit_job_manager/server/qiskit_job_manager_server/main.py
        ```
   2. Run the code with the main function:
        ```python
            from qiskit_job_manager_server import run_server

            run_server()
        ```


## Running with Docker

Example configuration files: [dockerfile](qiskit_job_manager/server/dockerfile) and [docker-compose.yaml](qiskit_job_manager/server/docker-compose.yaml) are in [qiskit_job_manager/server](qiskit_job_manager/server).


# Client

## Feature

* [X] Basic APIs for interacting with `qiskit_job_manager_server`.
* [X] Based on [aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) for async operations.

## Set up

1. Install qiskit_job_manager_client package:
   1. Change to the path `qiskit_job_manager/client`.
   2. Install the package by entering the command:
        ```shellscript
            $ pip install .
        ```

2. Configure the environment variables:
   1. Change to the path `qiskit_job_manager/client/qiskit_job_manager_client/configure`
   2. Under the path, copy `.env_example` to `.env` by entering the command:
        ```shellscript
            $ cp .env_example .env
        ```
   3. Edit `.env` to change the environment variables.

## Usage

**Notice that many below operations can be async operations when adding `_async` to the end of the class methods**

1. Client initialization
   1. Initialize the object
        ```python
        client = JobManagerClient()
        ```

        or 

        ```python
        client = JobManagerClient(host_url = None, host_port = None, email = None, password = None)
        ```
   2. Temporarily change the account
        ```python
        client.login(email = "", password = "")
        ```

2. User-related:
   1. Create a user (ibm_quantum_token is optional when creating the user)
        ```python
        client.create_user(email="", password="", ibm_quantum_token="")
        ```
   2. Print the information of the current login user
        ```python
        client.print_user_info()
        ```
   3. Update the information of the current login user
        ```python
        client.update_user_info(password="", ibm_quantum_token="")
        ```

3. Job-related:
   1. Add jobs
   
        The input job must be an IBMQJob object. 

        To register jobs, the input can be only one job, a list of jobs, or a list of jobs with any dimension.
        ```python
        job = job_1
        job = [job_1, job_2]
        job = [[job_1, job_2], [job_3]]
        ```

        For each job, `notify_status` is a list of [IBMQ job statuses](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.providers.JobStatus.html#qiskit.providers.JobStatus) which specify on entering which job status the server will send the email notification.

        `notify_status` is `None` by default, which means only registers "DONE" for every job.

        To specify `notify_status` other than "DONE", `notify_status` must have the same dimension as the input `job`.
        ```python
            client.register_job(job, notify_status=None)
        ```

        One way to quickly register jobs is `using register_start_and_done()`, which registers the first job as "RUNNING" and the last job as "DONE"
        ```python
        client.register_start_and_done(job)
        ```

   2. Print job information

        Print the information of all jobs
        ```python
        client.print_all_job_info()
        ```

        Print the information of a specified IBM job ID. Notice that job_id can also be a list of IDs with any dimension.
        ```python
        client.print_job_info(job_id)
        ```

   3. Update job information

        The input can be a `dict` or a list of `dict`.
        For the information schema, please find [Class JobSchema](qiskit_job_manager/server/qiskit_job_manager_server/schemas/job.py) in job_schema.
        ```python
        client.update_job_info({
             "job_id": "",
             "notify_status": [
                 "DONE", "CANCELED"
             ],
        })
        ```

   4. Delete jobs

        Notice that delete jobs only delete the jobs for qiskit_job_manager, so it will do nothing to what you submitted on the IBM Cloud.

        Delete by specifying a list of job IDs with any dimension.
        ```python
        client.delete_job(job_id)
        ```

        Or delete all jobs.
        ```python
        client.delete_all_job()
        ```

## Note for Jupyter Notebook
Due to issues with asyncio in Jupyter Notebook, it may raise the issue **RuntimeError: This event loop is already running in python**

Fix:
Install `nest_asyncio` and run:
```
import nest_asyncio
nest_asyncio.apply()
```
